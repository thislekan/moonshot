#### Things to note

- The styling and general look of the UI is bare.
- the focus was on functionality
- all but 4 features were implemented (some are buggy)

#### List of features completed

- [x] displays launches for up to 3 month on render
- [x] shows loader for when page is loading
- [x] allows filter by date selection i.e start date and end date
- [x] filter launches based on successful status of launches

#### List of features not completed

- [x] selecting point on the map to view launch details
- [x] filter launch based on agencies
- [x] receiving feedback based on errors
- [x] see first occuring launch based on selected start date

#### What can be improved?

- the UI could be improved, the page is not mobile friendly
- the UI (currently, it's skeletal)
- some elements are scattered across the UI
- tests (none written yet)
- cleanup (some components, DRY & KISS principles could be implemented)
- page limit (not smooth enough experience)
- implement debounce for some input fields
